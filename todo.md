## IA Considerations


### RECOMMENDATION:
For your MVP, I'd recommend POLYGON because:

1. EVM compatibility makes development easier
2. Very low fees make testing affordable
3. Strong tooling and documentation
4. Good balance of security and speed
5. Large developer community for support
6. Easy integration with existing Ethereum tools
7. Growing AI/Web3 ecosystem

The EVM compatibility is particularly important since you're building an AI contract generator - you can leverage existing Solidity templates and tools, which have the most comprehensive documentation and community support.

Key Technical Considerations:
- Use Hardhat or Truffle for development
- OpenZeppelin for contract templates
- IPFS for storing contract metadata
- Web3.js or ethers.js for frontend integration

#### Remember to:
1. Start with testnet
2. Implement thorough testing
3. Consider audit requirements
4. Plan for upgradability
5. Focus on security best practices

I liked your considerations, but I don't know polygon, neither Solidity. Can you guide me?


I'll help you get started with Polygon and Solidity development. Here's a structured learning path:

### 1. BASIC SETUP
```bash
# Install Node.js and npm first, then:
npm install -g hardhat
npx hardhat init    # Creates a new Hardhat project
```

### 2. ESSENTIAL TOOLS
- MetaMask (Wallet)
- Hardhat (Development environment)
- OpenZeppelin (Security-audited contract templates)
- Remix IDE (Browser-based Solidity IDE)
