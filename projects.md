Small project ideas to practice Solidity and build a portfolio:

1. **Simple Token Contract**: Create an ERC20 token with basic functionalities like minting, burning, and transferring tokens. This will help you understand the fundamentals of token standards.

2. **Voting System**: Develop a decentralized voting system where users can create polls, vote, and see results. This project will teach you about state management and user interactions in smart contracts.

3. **Crowdfunding Platform**: Build a smart contract that allows users to create and fund projects. Implement features like goal setting, deadlines, and refund mechanisms if the goal is not met.

4. **Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**: Create a simple DEX where users can swap tokens. This project will help you understand liquidity pools and automated market makers.

5. **NFT Marketplace**: Develop a platform where users can mint, buy, and sell NFTs. This will give you experience with ERC721 tokens and marketplace logic.

6. **Lottery System**: Implement a decentralized lottery where users can buy tickets, and a winner is randomly selected. This project will teach you about randomness and fairness in smart contracts.

7. **Escrow Service**: Create a smart contract that acts as an escrow service for transactions between two parties. This will help you understand conditional payments and trustless transactions.

8. **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**: Build a basic DAO where token holders can propose and vote on changes. This project will introduce you to governance models and decision-making processes.

9. **Supply Chain Management**: Develop a smart contract to track the movement of goods through a supply chain. This will help you understand data storage and access control in Solidity.

10. **Savings Account**: Create a smart contract that allows users to deposit funds and earn interest over time. This project will teach you about financial contracts and interest calculations.
